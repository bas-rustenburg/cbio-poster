 \block{Basic Block}{
 Among the most fundamental molecular interactions in biology are those of small molecules with their proteins.
  %
  Endogenous small molecules play the role of messengers in many signaling pathways of the cell, and small molecule drugs interact with proteins in signaling cascades to modulate their function.
%
  \textbf{  Despite having catalogued many of the physical driving forces behind small molecule recognition, there are enormous gaps in our knowledge preventing us from articulating a quantitative, predictive understanding of small molecule affinities and selectivities for biomolecules.
  }  
  In principle, \textit{alchemical free energy calculations} provide a framework for quantitatively describing all aspects of the thermodynamics of small molecule recognition.
%
  However, deficiencies in our quantitative understanding of binding create large challenges in the ability of these calculations to reproduce experimental affinities in many systems, holding back their use in probing function and aiding design.
